# 🧠 Cyber Vibecoding Standards (CVS)

**Fast code. Conscious code.**

The **Cyber Vibecoding Standards (CVS)** initiative is an open effort to define 
global, machine-readable standards for security, transparency, privacy, and ethics 
in AI-driven software development.

We believe that *speed without responsibility* is not progress —  
and that every line of AI-generated code should be safe, compliant, and traceable by design.

---

## 📜 Mission
To create a global, open, and adaptive framework of cyber and ethical standards 
that every AI-driven project can inherit automatically.
